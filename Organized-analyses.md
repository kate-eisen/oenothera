## Questions

Do floral traits vary across populations?

If floral traits vary across populations, are patterns of variation
clinal, associated with variation in pollinators, or random?

## Floral traits that could vary

*make a table here of traits and how to assess
them*

| Trait                                         | Approach                                                                                                                       |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Floral scent, total emission rate             | Linear mixed model analysis across populations                                                                                 |
| Floral scent, compound diversity              | Linear mixed model analysis of the number of compounds in samples across populations                                           |
| Floral scent, blend composition               | Multivariate analysis (e.g. Adonis) plus constrained ordination. Options:                                                      |
|                                               | 1\. Ordinate on percentage abundance in each sample                                                                            |
|                                               | 2\. Ordinate on emission rates in each sample                                                                                  |
|                                               | 3\. Ordinate on presence/absence                                                                                               |
| Floral scent, emission rates of key compounds | First, identify what the key compound are. Second, linear mixed model analysis to compare across populations.                  |
| Floral morphology                             | Multivariate analysis (e.g. Adonis) plus constrained ordination, followed by univariate mixed model analyses of key variables. |
